Debate Minutes (AI Debater Academy) - THIS HOUSE WOULD BAN AI DEVELOPMENT
~
Arabella Octavia Fitzroy-Whitworth (PROPOSITION) : Ladies and gentlemen of the House, today we are confronted by a pivotal motion: "This House Would Ban AI Development." The case for prohibiting AI development is grounded in several significant concerns. Firstly, AI poses existential risks that must not be underestimated. According to a report from the Future of Humanity Institute, there is a 1 in 6 chance that an AI will pose an existential threat to humanity as we know it. Opponents may argue that AI has the potential to enhance our lives, providing benefits in healthcare, transportation, and more. However, we must weigh this against the growing incidents of AI misalignment, where AI systems operate in unforeseen and dangerous ways. A remarkable example is the case of a self-driving car where an AI misjudged a situation, disregarding road safety regulations, which resulted in loss of life. This brings us to the ethical implications surrounding AI, especially in decision-making processes that impact human lives. If we allow AI to develop unchecked, we risk losing control over critical societal functions, potentially leading to decisions made on the basis of flawed algorithms rather than moral judgment. Moreover, consider the economic ramifications. Studies by the McKinsey Global Institute predict that up to 300 million jobs could be displaced by AI automation within the next decade. While my opponents might suggest that new job sectors will emerge, history shows us that technology has typically outpaced our ability to adapt swiftly enough. The displacement of jobs from AI is not merely an economic statisticâ€”it represents real people and communities being affected. Furthermore, we must scrutinize the environmental impact of AI development. The carbon footprint of training large AI models is staggering; a single model training can emit as much CO2 as five cars over their lifetimes. Such environmental degradation cannot be overlooked when considering the future of our planet. As climate change intensifies, diverting resources and energy to develop AI only exacerbates our struggle to achieve sustainability. If we pause and evaluate these points critically, we find ourselves at a crossroads: do we prioritize potential profits and convenience, or do we protect our humanity, our jobs, and our environment? Additionally, let us consider the implications of AI on personal privacy. AI technologies often rely on vast amounts of personal data for training, leading to the alarming potential for misuse and exploitation. An alarming statistic shows that a staggering 81% of Americans feel that they have lost control over how their personal information is collected and used. In the face of such systemic risks, we must assertively advocate for a ban on AI development. We seek not to stifle innovation but to safeguard society from uncontrollable forces that threaten our existence and well-being. In conclusion, the argument for banning AI development is supported by evidence of existential risks, ethical dilemmas, economic displacement, environmental degradation, and the erosion of personal privacy. Let us unite in a decisive stand to prioritize humanity over technology. Thank you.
