Arabella Octavia Fitzroy-Whitworth (PROPOSITION) : Honourable members of the house, I stand firmly in support of the motion before us today. In the current climate of economic uncertainty and social inequality, it is imperative that we advocate for change that benefits the majority rather than a select few. My opponents may argue that the status quo preserves stability and fosters growth; however, letâ€™s consider the alarming statistic that the wealthiest 1% now holds over 43% of global wealth according to the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report. This disparity stifles opportunity and breeds dissent, leading to instability. Furthermore, social mobility in many developed countries is on the decline, with studies showing that the likelihood of an individual from a low-income background achieving upward mobility has halved in the last few decades. My opponents might cite the potential risks of radical reforms, yet a Pew Research study indicates that nearly 70% of Americans believe that government should do more to address inequality, demonstrating a clear mandate for change. The fear of change must not outweigh the urgent need for equity, as history repeatedly shows that stagnation breeds revolution. Moreover, by investing in education and universal healthcare, we can increase productivity and innovation, as supported by numerous studies linking these investments to economic growth. If we remain stuck in a narrative of fear, we risk perpetuating a system that fails to serve the many. Let us not forget the impact of technological advancement, with automation poised to displace millions of jobs; proactive reform is needed to ensure that those displaced are supported through reskilling and reintegration into the workforce. In conclusion, the moral and economic imperatives for change are clear. We must decide today to act for the future we seek, one that is equitable, just, and serves all citizens, not just the privileged few. Thank you.
